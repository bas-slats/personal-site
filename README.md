# personal-site

This is a personal website, designed to serve as a platform for sharing technical projects and experiences. The website is built using simple HTML and is styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean and modern aesthetic. The content is served using Nginx, which is hosted within a Docker container for easy deployment and scalability. The Docker container can be built and run locally for development purposes, and can also be easily deployed to a live server. The website is accessible via both a custom domain and localhost for flexibility and ease of use. The source code, Dockerfile, and deployment scripts are all version-controlled using Git, allowing for efficient updates and iterative development.
